## overview
This is a script to capture the origin images' url from google image search web page.
	
## usage
There are two steps you should follow to get the result:
	
	# scroll down the page to end
	# load the script (by bookmarklet)

The first step is to load all of the preview image, which the origin url of the image comes from.

The second step is to load the script. After the script loaded, a dialog window will be shown at the top left conner. The origin images' url in the current page will be listed in the dialog.

The dialog will get focus and the text inside will be selected by default. So you can just press `Ctrl+C` to copy it.

You can use a hotkey to show or hide the dialog. Each time the dialog shows, the script will recapture the urls.

## hotkey
There is an hotkey to show or hide the dialog.

You can use the key `ESC` to toggle the status of dialog.
